# Evaluation of chess libraries for Python

This repository serves the purpose of evaluating chess libraries for Python with the aim of developing a chess AI.

Therefore the necessary functions for the chess game should be tested with different scripts. They should be stored, so that they can be reused later if necessary.

The librarie should contain functions for 
- Create a new chess board with default positioning of the chess pieces
- Print the chess board as ASCII code
- Push the moves of the chess pieces 
- Calculating all legal moves from a given chess board
- Check if one player is in check/checkmate

Optionally it is also possible to
- Have a graphical UI for the chess match 
	- The player can move the chess pieces 
- Print the chess board as image to a JupyterNotebook
- Show possible moves for one special piece
	- Print those as image to a JupyterNotebook
	
Of course, a good documentation would also be welcomned
